# UseCase10
Repository for Use Case #10 of Generative AI project. The user has two fields for input, one of which is optional, a button to start checking through regex and a field for outputting the result.

During implementation, I copied another project template from Android Studio (Empty Views Activity) and replaced the existing empty template with it. Next, I made a method stub with regex and wrote all the remaining code (UI and interaction with the target method). Then I Googled "regex for password" and copied the regex from the site https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19605150/regex-for-password-must-contain-at-least-eight-characters-at-least-one-number-a. After that, I corrected the code and tested it, followed by re-correction.

Tests can be run as standard unit tests (launch icon next to the test class in the IDE).
